# Metaheuristic-Optimizer-for-Feature-Selection

The following is followed to the implementation of the binary selection optimizer:
  1. Preparation of Data
  2. Feature Engineering -  Extraction of features 
  3. Feature Engineering -  Normalization
  4. Training Model Implementation and Evaluation
  5. Optimzation model Implementation, Calibration and Estimation
  
  
 ## Preparation of Data
 
 1. UCI Repository Data
 Since the study on a new algortihm of optimzation is made. the feature selection process should be studies from the data obtained from various resources. Here, as the result of dataset preparation, we are using the data from repositories of University of California Irvine. we are cateforizing to small, medium and large dataset based on the size of the features. The data with less than 15 feature are called small data, between 25 to 30 is medium and greater than 30 features are grouped to large data. The details of the data can be found in folder

2. EMG Data
3. FSR Data
